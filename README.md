# StayFitShop

This is a SwiftUI shopping app I made for my [iOS Developer Portfolio](https://viktormauzer.github.io). Products are being downloaded from the server and saved to device as cached versions using Core Data along with user profile and cart information.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run in Xcode. Make sure the [SDWebImageSwiftUI](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI) dependency I used for caching images has been installed.
